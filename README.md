# Pawtrol-AI
Pawtrol AI is an Intelligent animal monitoring system that is designed to assist pet owners and animal shelters in tracking and understanding animal behavior. Pawtrol AI combines many technologies such as Machine learning, Large language models, and computer vision. Pawltrol reports things like an animal pacing for 30 seconds, or even if an animal may appear to be hungry or not. 

Neural network:  detect specific animal behaviors in real time (“Animal has been pacing for a minute”, “dog drank water 30 seconds ago”)
Behavioral learning: Via machine learning, Pawtrol will learn from recurring actions that an animal does, report them, and help keep the owner on track for what the animal needs.
Automatic reporting: Using an LLM that creates daily summary reports, and alerts.
Smart alerts: They notify users whenever unusual behavior are, or may have been detected.
*User Dashboard (possible feature)*: Will be used for viewing, and checking live feeds, summaries, and recommendations.
